# Architecture

This folder contains the system architecture diagrams and notes.

Files:
- `diagram.mmd`: Mermaid source for the high-level architecture. You can view it with Mermaid tools or import it into diagrams.net (draw.io).

How to use in diagrams.net (draw.io):
1. Open https://app.diagrams.net/
2. File → Import → select `diagram.mmd`
3. Edit and export as PNG/SVG/PDF as needed.

Tips:
- Keep Mermaid sources committed; export images to `screenshots/` if you want to share visuals.
- Add more diagrams as `*.mmd` files (e.g., `sequence-api.mmd`, `c4-context.mmd`).
